we should not use any unofficial package for any of it, and keep it as much framework independant as possible
and we should provide a "Subscribable Auth state" & provide all the options for each and every auth that their providers provide through their native sdk/api to end user

each and every mentioned auth service/option, should be easily configurable and with all the options that their provider provides

the solution should be fully type safe, framework independant, secure, highly performant, and should use all the bst coding practices and standards.
